Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
    * Bill amount is the first responder

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: 
- Uploading the app to GitHub. Had an issue with local git repository not pointing to the remote branch. Ended up putting the project into a separate folder and starting with a fresh git repository.
